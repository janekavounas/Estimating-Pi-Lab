# Estimating-Pi-Lab

This is a lab from my Engineering 19 Lab where I estimated pi using 3 different methods. The first is the Monte Carlo Method which takes a random variable from a range and divides by how many random numbers were taken. This is a very simple stochastic method. The next is Integration by Riemann Sums. This takes an area under an interval to estimate pi. The final method is a Taylor Series of power 3. This method Taylor expands the equation that is used to calculate pi normally, and solves the expanded equation for certain values of x.
